The Settings page has multiple categories on the left navigation bar.

The Settings page lets you edit the Support details that you provided while registering for vacation labs. These details include company name, website, support email, notification email, support phone, booking website, booking terms URL and mailing address.

The branding tab gives you good control over your storefront customization. You can upload/change your logo, background image, booking website banner and favicon through the settings.
