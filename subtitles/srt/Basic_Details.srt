00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800


2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,033
Hi and welcome to the Vacation Labs booking engine. This video will take you through the process of  

3
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:13,266
creating a product which could be your tour, trip or an activity. 

4
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:18,932
You can create a new tour by clicking on the new trip button on your dashboard

5
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:21,599
or the one in your product section.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,966
which gives you an option choose the type of product you wish to create.  

7
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:32,332
But, first let’s understand, that how would you categorize your product into the given options. 

8
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:41,833
Any tour or activity which will last only a couple of hours or less than a day will fall under the category of Short Tours. For example 

9
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:48,199
a 3 hrs walking tour in Old Delhi or a day sightseeing tour in Mumbai. 

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:57,500
Activities like paragliding, Jet Ski rides, Bunjee Jumping etc which last only a couple of minutes will also come under the same section.

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,300
In the Multi Day Tour category you can add tours which last for more than one day.

12
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:12,333
This can be a weekend getaway of 2-3 days or a tour package of 10-12 days or more. For example the famous Golden Triangle tours 

13
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:18,366
which usually lasts 2-3 days and cover Delhi-Agra and Jaipur sightseeing,  

14
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:25,266
or a complete South India Tour package of 6-7 days.

15
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:26,132
they all will come under the category of multi day tour.

16
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:29,499
A class or a certification course on the other hand

17
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,866
would be a recurring program of short duration with fixed dates and schedules. Like a Guitar Learning Class, a dance class,

18
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:44,266
 Cooking class or a 3 months summer course of painting or learning software.

19
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:45,766


20
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:47,966
Let’s just start with a short tour, the assist of the shuttle

21
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:51,332
say a Delhi walking tour of 3 hours.

22
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:55,266
Begin with choosing whether the trip is shared or private. 

23
00:01:55,266 --> 00:02:02,566
A shared trip is basically the one in which individuals or groups, who book separately, but travel together. 

24
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:07,866
While in a Private tour a person or a group travel separately, i.e. the tour  

25
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:13,199
is operated exclusively for them and others will not be made part of that departure.

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:21,066
If you choose a Shared trip the system will allow bookings to happen till all seats in a particular timeslot are filled, but in Private trip, the booking 

27
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:26,332
system will keep on taking bookings until you manually close the booking.

28
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:32,099
Give your trip a name: In our example here we can call it a Delhi Walking Tour

29
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:41,666
Give your trip a unique code which helps you identify your trip. For example if you have a list of trips with similar names like Old Delhi Food 

30
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:48,066
Walk, Delhi market walk, Delhi heritage tour then you can quickly spot your trip through the unique code. 

31
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:53,432
Often if the trip name is too long it may not show up completely on mobile devices or text messages  

32
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:58,799
but you can immediately recognize it with the help of unique code.

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,233
Choose the duration of the trip. One of the most important things, which a customer want know about a short tour is, its duration. 

34
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:12,233
A day sightseeing tour of Mumbai can be of 6 hours also and 10 hours also. 

35
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:17,899
Telling your customers how long the trip will last makes it easier for them to decide.

36
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,266


37
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:26,366
You can also set the number of minimum and maximum participants the trip can accommodate. For example the walking tour 

38
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:29,932
can have min 2 participants and maximum 10, which would mean anyone who books will be able to make a booking only if they choose 2 or 

39
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:33,499
more seats. 

40
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,766


41
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:39,199
The booking system allows you to give your customers as much information as possible, 

42
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,133
which can include the pictures, details of the trip, what’s included in the price and what’s not etc. 

43
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:49,466
All the information you provide here shows up on the Trip Details Page. 

44
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:53,232
The Inclusions and exclusions though also show up on the booking form.

45
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,666
 Let’s start with giving the overview. 

46
00:03:55,666 --> 00:04:03,166
A brief description about the walking tour, which lets the customer know, what to expect during the tour and what the tour is about. 

47
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:07,632
For example in case of Delhi Walking tour it can something like this: 

48
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:10,266


49
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:15,899
The next section is Inclusions – where you mention everything that’s included within the price of the trip. 

50
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,266


51
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:22,966
For example, in this walking tour, the basic price includes the transport during the walk, 

52
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:24,999
snacks during the trip, 

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,533
tour guide etc. Let’s add that in.

54
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:33,599


55
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Within Exclusions you specify what is not included in the price of the trip, for example 

56
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,600
in this particular walking tour, we expect the guests to pay for their airport to hotel transfers, 

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,666
travel insurance, VISA charges etc. Let’s add those as Exclusions. 

58
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,332


59
00:04:54,333 --> 00:05:00,299
With the Highlights you try to give the customer a gist of what one will experience during the trip. 

60
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,100
This can be a list of attractions or names of famous locations or monuments to be visited during the tour. 

61
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:14,666
In this tour we will be visiting the monuments like Red Fort and Jama Masjid and the famous Chandni Chowk market. 

62
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,399
Let's add this information to the highlights

63
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,866


64
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:27,599
Now, as a general guideline, it’s preferable to add Inclusions, Exclusions, and Highlights as bulleted points because they are easier for your 

65
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,466
customer to read. However, if you feel that a paragraph of text works better, then you can use that as well.

66
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:40,766
Just a note, only the overview is a mandatory field. Inclusions, exclusions, and highlights are optional. 

67
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:49,166
So, for example, if the tour that you’re creating is very, very short, 15 min Jet-Ski ride, having a “Highlights” 

68
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:54,799
section may not make sense for that. So, you can leave that out by un-checking this checkbox.  

69
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,900
So, the options which you have un-checked here will not show up on the trip details page.

70
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,500
Last, but one of the very important parts is the pictures. 

71
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,700
Make sure that you upload attractive pictures related to your trip, which would be visible on your trip details page along with all the other 

72
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,933
information provided in the basic details section. 

73
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:23,766
You can also add general or tour specific terms and conditions. A travel firm which deals in short tours or walking tours, 

74
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:30,966
a safety disclaimer and a refund policy could be common for all the trips, thus they can come under General terms and conditions. 

75
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:38,699
But things like dress code might be applicable only on those tours which include visits to religious places. 

76
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:45,666
A disclaimer on eating local food and beverage would make more sense for food specific tours. 

77
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:53,332
The general terms and conditions can be mentioned only once by clicking on this and the same will appear on all the tours which are 

78
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:58,466
visible on the booking form, right before making the payment.

79
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:05,532
Make sure that all the information you have mentioned is correct. Once done, click on Save and Next to proceed to the next step.

80
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:13,466
