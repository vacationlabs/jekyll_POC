  Hi and welcome to the Vacation Labs booking engine. This video will take you through the process of
  </span><br>
  <span id="line3" start="9" end="13">
  creating a product which could be your tour, trip or an activity.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line4" start="13" end="18">
  You can create a new tour by clicking on the new trip button on your dashboard
  </span><br>
  <span id="line5" start="18" end="21">
  or the one in your product section.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line6" start="21" end="26">
  which gives you an option choose the type of product you wish to create.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line7" start="26" end="32">
  But, first let’s understand, that how would you categorize your product into the given options.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line8" start="32" end="41">
  Any tour or activity which will last only a couple of hours or less than a day will fall under the category of Short Tours. For example
  </span><br>
  <span id="line9" start="41" end="48">
  a 3 hrs walking tour in Old Delhi or a day sightseeing tour in Mumbai.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line10" start="48" end="57">
  Activities like paragliding, Jet Ski rides, Bunjee Jumping etc which last only a couple of minutes will also come under the same section.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line11" start="57" end="63">
  In the Multi Day Tour category you can add tours which last for more than one day.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line12" start="63" end="72">
  This can be a weekend getaway of 2-3 days or a tour package of 10-12 days or more. For example the famous Golden Triangle tours
  </span><br>
  <span id="line13" start="72" end="78">
  which usually lasts 2-3 days and cover Delhi-Agra and Jaipur sightseeing,
  </span><br>
  <span id="line14" start="78" end="85">
  or a complete South India Tour package of 6-7 days.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line15" start="85" end="86">
  they all will come under the category of multi day tour.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line16" start="86" end="89">
  A class or a certification course on the other hand
  </span><br>
  <span id="line17" start="89" end="96">
  would be a recurring program of short duration with fixed dates and schedules. Like a Guitar Learning Class, a dance class,
  </span><br>
  <span id="line18" start="96" end="104">
  Cooking class or a 3 months summer course of painting or learning software.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line19" start="104" end="105">
  
  </span><br>
  <span id="line20" start="105" end="107">
  Let’s just start with a short tour, the assist of the shuttle
  </span><br>
  <span id="line21" start="107" end="111">
  say a Delhi walking tour of 3 hours.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line22" start="111" end="115">
  Begin with choosing whether the trip is shared or private.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line23" start="115" end="122">
  A shared trip is basically the one in which individuals or groups, who book separately, but travel together.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line24" start="122" end="127">
  While in a Private tour a person or a group travel separately, i.e. the tour
  </span><br>
  <span id="line25" start="127" end="133">
  is operated exclusively for them and others will not be made part of that departure.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line26" start="133" end="141">
  If you choose a Shared trip the system will allow bookings to happen till all seats in a particular timeslot are filled, but in Private trip, the booking
  </span><br>
  <span id="line27" start="141" end="146">
  system will keep on taking bookings until you manually close the booking.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line28" start="146" end="152">
  Give your trip a name: In our example here we can call it a Delhi Walking Tour
  </span><br>
  <span id="line29" start="152" end="161">
  Give your trip a unique code which helps you identify your trip. For example if you have a list of trips with similar names like Old Delhi Food
  </span><br>
  <span id="line30" start="161" end="168">
  Walk, Delhi market walk, Delhi heritage tour then you can quickly spot your trip through the unique code.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line31" start="168" end="173">
  Often if the trip name is too long it may not show up completely on mobile devices or text messages
  </span><br>
  <span id="line32" start="173" end="178">
  but you can immediately recognize it with the help of unique code.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line33" start="178" end="186">
  Choose the duration of the trip. One of the most important things, which a customer want know about a short tour is, its duration.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line34" start="186" end="192">
  A day sightseeing tour of Mumbai can be of 6 hours also and 10 hours also.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line35" start="192" end="197">
  Telling your customers how long the trip will last makes it easier for them to decide.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line36" start="197" end="199">
  
  </span><br>
  <span id="line37" start="199" end="206">
  You can also set the number of minimum and maximum participants the trip can accommodate. For example the walking tour
  </span><br>
  <span id="line38" start="206" end="209">
  can have min 2 participants and maximum 10, which would mean anyone who books will be able to make a booking only if they choose 2 or
  </span><br>
  <span id="line39" start="209" end="213">
  more seats.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line40" start="213" end="214">
  
  </span><br>
  <span id="line41" start="214" end="219">
  The booking system allows you to give your customers as much information as possible,
  </span><br>
  <span id="line42" start="219" end="225">
  which can include the pictures, details of the trip, what’s included in the price and what’s not etc.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line43" start="225" end="229">
  All the information you provide here shows up on the Trip Details Page.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line44" start="229" end="233">
  The Inclusions and exclusions though also show up on the booking form.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line45" start="233" end="235">
  Let’s start with giving the overview.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line46" start="235" end="243">
  A brief description about the walking tour, which lets the customer know, what to expect during the tour and what the tour is about.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line47" start="243" end="247">
  For example in case of Delhi Walking tour it can something like this:
  </span><br>
  <span id="line48" start="247" end="250">
  
  </span><br>
  <span id="line49" start="250" end="255">
  The next section is Inclusions – where you mention everything that’s included within the price of the trip.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line50" start="255" end="257">
  
  </span><br>
  <span id="line51" start="257" end="262">
  For example, in this walking tour, the basic price includes the transport during the walk,
  </span><br>
  <span id="line52" start="262" end="264">
  snacks during the trip,
  </span><br>
  <span id="line53" start="265" end="268">
  tour guide etc. Let’s add that in.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line54" start="268" end="273">
  
  </span><br>
  <span id="line55" start="273" end="279">
  Within Exclusions you specify what is not included in the price of the trip, for example
  </span><br>
  <span id="line56" start="279" end="285">
  in this particular walking tour, we expect the guests to pay for their airport to hotel transfers,
  </span><br>
  <span id="line57" start="285" end="291">
  travel insurance, VISA charges etc. Let’s add those as Exclusions.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line58" start="291" end="294">
  
  </span><br>
  <span id="line59" start="294" end="300">
  With the Highlights you try to give the customer a gist of what one will experience during the trip.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line60" start="300" end="307">
  This can be a list of attractions or names of famous locations or monuments to be visited during the tour.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line61" start="307" end="314">
  In this tour we will be visiting the monuments like Red Fort and Jama Masjid and the famous Chandni Chowk market.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line62" start="314" end="317">
  Let's add this information to the highlights
  </span><br>
  <span id="line63" start="317" end="318">
  
  </span><br>
  <span id="line64" start="318" end="327">
  Now, as a general guideline, it’s preferable to add Inclusions, Exclusions, and Highlights as bulleted points because they are easier for your
  </span><br>
  <span id="line65" start="327" end="333">
  customer to read. However, if you feel that a paragraph of text works better, then you can use that as well.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line66" start="333" end="340">
  Just a note, only the overview is a mandatory field. Inclusions, exclusions, and highlights are optional.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line67" start="340" end="349">
  So, for example, if the tour that you’re creating is very, very short, 15 min Jet-Ski ride, having a “Highlights”
  </span><br>
  <span id="line68" start="349" end="354">
  section may not make sense for that. So, you can leave that out by un-checking this checkbox.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line69" start="354" end="360">
  So, the options which you have un-checked here will not show up on the trip details page.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line70" start="360" end="364">
  Last, but one of the very important parts is the pictures.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line71" start="364" end="369">
  Make sure that you upload attractive pictures related to your trip, which would be visible on your trip details page along with all the other
  </span><br>
  <span id="line72" start="369" end="374">
  information provided in the basic details section.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line73" start="374" end="383">
  You can also add general or tour specific terms and conditions. A travel firm which deals in short tours or walking tours,
  </span><br>
  <span id="line74" start="383" end="390">
  a safety disclaimer and a refund policy could be common for all the trips, thus they can come under General terms and conditions.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line75" start="390" end="398">
  But things like dress code might be applicable only on those tours which include visits to religious places.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line76" start="398" end="405">
  A disclaimer on eating local food and beverage would make more sense for food specific tours.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line77" start="405" end="413">
  The general terms and conditions can be mentioned only once by clicking on this and the same will appear on all the tours which are
  </span><br>
  <span id="line78" start="413" end="418">
  visible on the booking form, right before making the payment.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line79" start="418" end="425">
  Make sure that all the information you have mentioned is correct. Once done, click on Save and Next to proceed to the next step.
  </span><br>
  <span id="line80" start="425" end="433">
